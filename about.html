        <br></br> Founded in July, 1998, we have grown to a firm of over twenty lawyers. We are continuing to grow because we understand that our clients hire us for service, and we listen to their needs. We have the size to handle substantial matters while still maintaining the personal touch and partner supervision that makes MSSSV unique.
        <br></br><span class = "title"> What We Do </span>
        <br> </br>We vigorously represent our clients’ interests on a wide-range of matters. Whether it is in the areas of civil rights, employment discrimination, insurance coverage matters, professional liability, property damage, or complex tort cases ranging from trucker accidents to construction accidents, to pharmaceutical, product and toxic tort litigation, our firm offers skilled and knowledgeable counsel, whose emphasis is on quality and the expedient resolution of matters for our clients. In this regard, our firm utilizes leading computer technology and we successfully employ case management systems, document management software, e-mail, remote communications and a variety of other applications, all of which enable us to better serve our clients.
